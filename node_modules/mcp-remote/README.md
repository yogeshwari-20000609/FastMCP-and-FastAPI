# `mcp-remote`

Connect an MCP Client that only supports local (stdio) servers to a Remote MCP Server, with auth support:

**Note: this is a working proof-of-concept** but should be considered **experimental**.

## Why is this necessary?

So far, the majority of MCP servers in the wild are installed locally, using the stdio transport. This has some benefits: both the client and the server can implicitly trust each other as the user has granted them both permission to run. Adding secrets like API keys can be done using environment variables and never leave your machine. And building on `npx` and `uvx` has allowed users to avoid explicit install steps, too.

But there's a reason most software that _could_ be moved to the web _did_ get moved to the web: it's so much easier to find and fix bugs & iterate on new features when you can push updates to all your users with a single deploy.

With the MCP [Authorization specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization/) nearing completion, we now have a secure way of sharing our MCP servers with the world _without_ running code on user's laptops. Or at least, you would, if all the popular MCP _clients_ supported it yet. Most are stdio-only, and those that _do_ support HTTP+SSE don't yet support the OAuth flows required.

That's where `mcp-remote` comes in. As soon as your chosen MCP client supports remote, authorized servers, you can remove it. Until that time, drop in this one liner and dress for the MCP clients you want!

## Usage

All the most popular MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor & Windsurf) use the following config format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-example": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote.mcp.server/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Flags

* If `npx` is producing errors, consider adding `-y` as the first argument to auto-accept the installation of the `mcp-remote` package.

```json
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y"
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote.mcp.server/sse"
      ]
```

* To force `npx` to always check for an updated version of `mcp-remote`, add the `@latest` flag:

```json
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "https://remote.mcp.server/sse"
      ]
```

* To force `mcp-remote` to ignore any existing access tokens and begin the authorization flow anew, pass `--clean`.

```json
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote.mcp.server/sse",
        "--clean"
      ]
```

* To change which port `mcp-remote` listens for an OAuth redirect (by default `3334`), add an additional argument after the server URL. Note that whatever port you specify, if it is unavailable an open port will be chosen at random.

```json
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote.mcp.server/sse",
        "9696"
      ]
```

### Claude Desktop

[Official Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

In order to add an MCP server to Claude Desktop you need to edit the configuration file located at:

* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

If it does not exist yet, [you may need to enable it under Settings > Developer](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#2-add-the-filesystem-mcp-server).

Restart Claude Desktop to pick up the changes in the configuration file.
Upon restarting, you should see a hammer icon in the bottom right corner
of the input box.

### Cursor

[Official Docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol). The configuration file is located at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.

As of version `0.48.0`, Cursor supports unauthed SSE servers directly. If your MCP server is using the official MCP OAuth authorization protocol, you still need to add a **"command"** server and call `mcp-remote`.

### Windsurf

[Official Docs](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/mcp). The configuration file is located at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`.

## Building Remote MCP Servers

## Troubleshooting

### Clear your `~/.mcp-auth` directory

`mcp-remote` stores all the credential information inside `~/.mcp-auth` (or wherever your `MCP_REMOTE_CONFIG_DIR` points to). If you're having persistent issues, try running:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
```

Then restarting your MCP client.

### Check your Node version

Make sure that the version of Node you have installed is [18 or 
higher](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server). Claude
Desktop will use your system version of Node, even if you have a newer
version installed elsewhere.

### Restart Claude

When modifying `claude_desktop_config.json` it can helpful to completely restart Claude

### VPN Certs

You may run into issues if you are behind a VPN, you can try setting the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
environment variable to point to the CA certificate file. If using `claude_desktop_config.json`,
this might look like:

```json
{
 "mcpServers": {
    "remote-example": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote.mcp.server/sse"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS": "{your CA certificate file path}.pem"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Check the logs

* [Follow Claude Desktop logs in real-time](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging#debugging-in-claude-desktop)
* MacOS / Linux:<br/>`tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
* For bash on WSL:<br/>`tail -n 20 -f "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Claude\Logs\mcp.log"`
* Powershell: <br/>`Get-Content "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Claude\Logs\mcp.log" -Wait -Tail 20`

## Debugging

If you encounter the following error, returned by the `/callback` URL:

```
Authentication Error
Token exchange failed: HTTP 400
```

You can run `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth` to clear any locally stored state and tokens.

### "Client" mode

Run the following on the command line (not from an MCP server):

```shell
npx -p mcp-remote@latest mcp-remote-client https://remote.mcp.server/sse
```

This will run through the entire authorization flow and attempt to list the tools & resources at the remote URL. Pair this with `--clean` or after running `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth` to see if stale credentials are your problem, otherwise hopefully the issue will be more obvious in these logs than those in your MCP client.
